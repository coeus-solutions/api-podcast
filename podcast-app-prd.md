# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Podcast Management Application

## Overview
The Podcast Management Application allows users to upload podcast audio files, automatically extract key points from the audio, and generate shareable audio clips of the extracted key points. This app streamlines podcast content sharing and enhances user engagement by leveraging AI-driven audio processing.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Authentication
* Users should be able to sign up and log in to the app using an email and password.
* Implement password recovery options (e.g., "Forgot Password").

### 2. Audio Upload
* Users should be able to upload MP3 audio files for processing.
* Enforce file size and format limitations (e.g., MP3 only, max size 100MB).

### 3. Key Point Extraction
* The system should process uploaded audio to:
  * Transcribe the audio using OpenAI Whisper APIs.
  * Extract key points using OpenAI ChatCompletion APIs.

### 4. Transcript and Timestamp Generation
* Generate a full transcript of the audio.
* Include timestamps for each extracted key point in the transcript.

### 5. Audio Clip Creation
* Using timestamps from the transcription, create audio clips for each key point by slicing the original audio file with **pydub**.

### 6. Audio and Transcript Management
* Users should be able to view a list of all previously uploaded audio files.
* For each uploaded file, display:
  * The full transcript.
  * Extracted key points with their timestamps.
  * Generated audio clips.

### 7. Sharing Features
* Users should be able to share individual audio clips to social media platforms (e.g., Facebook) directly from the app.

### 8. Landing Page
* The app should feature a landing page showcasing its key features, user testimonials, and pricing plans (if applicable).

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Tech Stack
* **Frontend**: ReactJS
* **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
* **APIs**:
  * OpenAI Whisper API for transcription.
  * OpenAI ChatCompletion API for extracting key points.
* **Audio Processing**: Use **pydub** for slicing the original audio based on timestamps.

### 2. Performance
* Audio processing and key point extraction should complete within a reasonable time (under 2 minutes for files up to 30 minutes).

### 3. Responsive Design
* Ensure a fully responsive design that works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### 4. Dark Mode and Normal Mode
* Provide both light and dark themes for the frontend, with an easy toggle option for users.

### 5. Localization Support
* Frontend should support multiple languages for a global user base.

### 6. UI/UX Design
* Create a visually appealing, modern, and intuitive interface.
* Ensure smooth navigation and clear CTAs (Call to Actions).

## User Flow

1. **Sign Up / Login**
   * User signs up or logs into the app.

2. **Upload Audio**
   * User uploads an MP3 file for processing.

3. **Processing**
   * App transcribes the audio and extracts key points with timestamps.
   * App generates short audio clips for each key point.

4. **Viewing Results**
   * User views:
     * Full transcript.
     * Key points with timestamps.
     * Generated audio clips.

5. **Sharing**
   * User shares selected audio clips to social media platforms.

## API Integration

### 1. OpenAI Whisper API
* For converting audio to text.
* Input: MP3 file.
* Output: Full transcript with timestamps.

### 2. OpenAI ChatCompletion API
* For extracting key points from the transcript.
* Input: Transcript text.
* Output: Key points with associated timestamps.

### 3. Pydub
* For slicing audio based on timestamps.
* Input: Original audio file and timestamps.
* Output: Short audio clips.

## UI Features

### 1. Landing Page
* Feature overview.
* Sign-up and login buttons.
* Pricing plans and testimonials (if applicable).

### 2. Dashboard
* Upload new audio files.
* View previously uploaded files with processing results.

### 3. Processing Page
* Display real-time progress of transcription and key point extraction.

### 4. Results Page
* Display:
  * Full transcript.
  * Key points with timestamps.
  * Generated audio clips (playable and shareable).

### 5. Dark/Light Mode Toggle
* Easily accessible in the navigation bar.

## Milestones

1. **Week 1-2**: Setup project structure, authentication system, and landing page.
2. **Week 3-4**: Integrate OpenAI Whisper API and build transcription functionality.
3. **Week 5-6**: Integrate OpenAI ChatCompletion API for key point extraction.
4. **Week 7**: Implement audio slicing with **pydub** and generate audio clips.
5. **Week 8**: Finalize UI design, localization, and sharing features.
6. **Week 9**: Testing and bug fixes.
7. **Week 10**: Deployment and launch.

## Future Enhancements
* Add support for additional audio formats (e.g., WAV, AAC).
* Introduce AI-powered recommendations for editing or merging audio clips.
* Enable sharing to more platforms (e.g., Twitter, Instagram).
* Provide analytics on shared content (e.g., views, shares, engagement).
* Offer team collaboration features for podcast production teams.
